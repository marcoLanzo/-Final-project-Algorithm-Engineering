# Final-project-Algorithm-Engineering

The main objective of this work was to implement the Boruvka algorithm using the python programming language.
Boruvka, like Kruscal and Prim, has the functionality of determining a spanning tree of minimum cost for any undirected, connected and edge-weighted graph.

# Implementation Side 

- Creation of the **BuildRandomGraph** method starting from the already known BuildGraph method of the GraphHelper class.
  This function returns a random graph which allows to circumvent the problem of edge perturbation.

- Use of the **Itertools** function to make our structure more efficient in memor. It was used both to reduce the memory consumption capacity and to simplify the computational       work in the testing phase.

- Use of the **Argparse** module to create a very user-frindly command line interface.

- Use of the **Cprofile** module, an extension from C, capable of providing mathematical statics regarding the various functions used
